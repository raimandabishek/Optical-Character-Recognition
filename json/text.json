{"extracted_text": "1.1 What is computer vision?\n\nAs humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent\nease. Think of how vivid the three-dimensional percept is when you look at a vase of flowers\nsitting on the table next to you. You can tell the shape and translucency of each petal through\nthe subtle patterns of light and shading that play across its surface and effortlessly segment\neach flower from the background of the scene (Figure 1.1). Looking at a framed group por-\nwait, you can easily count (and name) all of the people in the picture and even guess at their\nemotions from their facial appearance. Perceptual psychologists have spent decades trying to\nunderstand how the visual system works and, even though they can devise optical illusions!\nto tease apart some of its principles (Figure 1.3), a complete solution to this puzzle remains\nelusive (Marr 1982; Palmer 1999; Livingstone 2008).\n"}
